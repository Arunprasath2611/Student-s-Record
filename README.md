# Student-s-Record
Created a dummy login page and a registration page with a Mock API to retrieve the data.

Workflow:

To start with, login to the webpage with  a Dummy Login which would validate only if the username and password contains atleast 8 chsracters.

Login process will be stored in the local storage.

After logging in, you would be redirected to the home page where a sequence of student's records will be displayed.

Click on any of the user name to know their details thoroughly. The details were fetched from Beeceptor API.
